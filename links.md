## Here are some links that I find helpful for this course

### [Linux From Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/)
This website helps provide a lot of information regarding Linux! 

### [Virtual Machine tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX75Z-4MEoM)
I found this YouTube video helpful for setting up my VM. It explains how VM works as well as the installation process.

### [What is Linux](https://www.guru99.com/introduction-linux.html)
This website briefly explains what is OS and how it works. In addition, it also covers about the history of linux. Other than that, if you go to the next page, you will see other linux-related tutorial. For instance, the installation process. 

### [GPG Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-MPcUHhXoc)
This week we were tasked to do generate **GnuPG keys**. The assignment is pretty straight forward, however I don't really understand its purpose.
Through this video, I'm able to understand the purpose of it and how it works. 

### [Creating and Managing a GPG Key Pair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vVIpIvboSg)
Pretty similar to the link above, but this time it's more technical since it shows me how to create GnuPG Keys from scratch in a detail way.

### [Cyber Security In 2 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2W_nNdReXM)
After wathing some parts from the 2 hour-long videos given in the slides, this brief video shows me the general idea of cyber security.

### [C Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.in/c-tutorial/)
This week we have some demos to try, however it's written in c-language. This website helped to understand the C language and its syntax.
